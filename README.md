## Features

Adds details and a documentation link above each [ESLint rule](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) (including [plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=eslint-plugin-&ranking=popularity)) in your configuration file located anywhere in your workspace (supports multiple config files).

Supports all configuration file formats currently [supported by ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-file-formats)

- JavaScript - use `.eslintrc.js` and export an object containing your configuration.
- YAML - use `.eslintrc.yaml` or `.eslintrc.yml` to define the configuration structure.
- JSON - use `.eslintrc.json` to define the configuration structure. ESLintâ€™s JSON files also allow JavaScript-style comments.
- Deprecated - use `.eslintrc`, which can be either JSON or YAML.
- package.json - create an `eslintConfig` property in your `package.json` file and define your configuration there.

If you are new to ESLint check the [documentation](http://eslint.org/).

## Requirements

In an effort to support all possible plugins and to keep size small, this extension uses ESLint plugins installed in the opened workspace folder(s).  Due to restrictions in vscode, this extension does not support globally installed packages.

## Known Issues

- Does not support globally installed eslint or eslint plugin packages
- ESLint v4.15.0 added an official location for rules to store a URL to their documentation in the rule metadata in [eslint/eslint#9788](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9788). This adds the URL to all the existing rules so anything consuming them can know where their documentation is without having to resort to external packages to guess.  If your plugin hasn't included this metadata, its possible you have an older version that needs to be updated.
- When using the JS configuration file format, this extension currently only supports rules existing in a single exports object at the root (`module.exports.rules`).
